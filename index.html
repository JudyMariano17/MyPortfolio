            <h2>Judy Mae Mariano</h2>
            <p class = "about">I'm a web developer focusing on the back end part. I am innovative, motivated, and hardworking. I am currently a Full Stack Ruby on Rails developer. Other than my job, I am also working part time as a mobile app developer of a start up company that is focusing on Agricultural Robot.</p>

            <h3>ABOUT ME AND MY FUTURE PLANS</h3>
            <p class = "about">Even though I am just new to the industry, I believe that I was able to acquire both technical skills and soft skills that would help me on my journey as a web developer. By learning different languages, I was able to realize that by having a great and deep understanding of the basic fundamentals of coding, it would help me create almost anything from scratch. It had also helped me learn new languages easily because every somehow all syntax are almost the same or have some similarities. </p>
            <p class = "about">5 years from now, I see myself as a project manager leading a team of developers. A project manager that would be able to share what I can and have and still keep on learning so that I would have something to pass on to new developers.</p>
            <p class = "about">8-10 years from now, I see myself as an independent contractor. Doing this, I believe will help me know more about the industry and learn more about different languages that will be trending in the near future</p>
